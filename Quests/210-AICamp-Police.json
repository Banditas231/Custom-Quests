    "Some thugs posing as police have taken over part of Staroye. They’ve been terrorizing nearby towns — shaking people down, even opening fire. These imposters are dangerous and need to be dealt with before more harm is done. Are you up for it?",
    "Head up to Staroye and clear the bastards out. They are a small group but they are well armed and dangerous. Be careful.",
