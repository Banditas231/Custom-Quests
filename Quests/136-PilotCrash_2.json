    "The storm took its toll, yet not all the disappearances can be blamed on thunder and lightning. We’ve heard stories of another aircraft that flew that night – one that never crashed, never landed, never called for help. Some say raiders forced it down. Others say it was captured by a group that doesn’t want to be found.",
    "If you’re brave enough, track the lead. If there’s truth to these whispers, this mission will be more dangerous than the last two.",
