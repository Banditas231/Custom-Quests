    "I… I didn’t think I’d make it. Name’s Hassan. I was just a fisherman, out at sea, when the storm came—violent, sudden. My boat didn’t stand a chance. Next thing I know, I wake up on a cold shore… tied up, blood dried on my face. Bandits. I don’t know how long I was out, but they kept me alive—for now. While they were passed out from booze or whatever they took, I found an old radio tower nearby. Managed to send a signal to the camp. It was my only shot. I’m weak. Lost. I don’t even know what this place is anymore. But if you can get me to that camp—if you can help me escape—there’s a stash there. Supplies I buried before all this. They're yours if you get me out of here alive.",
