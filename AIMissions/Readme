# ✅ **GitHub Update — Fixed and Formatted Version**

**From now on, everyone can choose which custom missions they want to use in `mainmission.json`.**

**All custom missions are stored in separate files.** Just open the folder with the mission you like and **copy-paste it into the main file**.

**If I am correct, you can now have up to 54 custom missions.**

## 📝 **How to Add Custom Missions to the Main File**

### **Step 1: Open Your Main Mission File**

**Inside it you will see something like this:**

```json
"Missions": [
    { /* Add the missions you think fit your server → all my custom missions are in separate files */ }
]
```

### **Step 2: Choose a Mission You Like**

**Each mission starts like this:**

```json
{
    "Name": "Balota_AF_Runway",
```

### **Step 3: Copy the Complete Mission**

**Each mission ends like this:**

```json
        "Rotation": [
            135.45835876464844,
            0.0,
            -0.0
        ]
    }
]
}
```

### **Step 4: Verify JSON Formatting**

**Make sure all `{}` and `[]` are correctly opened and closed.**
