**All files that I use on my server.**

**Hello, here are my Expansion Quests for the Chernogorsk map.** 
Some quests require mods for loot/eAI loadouts.

**Mods:** @MMG - Mighty's Military Gear, @SNAFU Weapons, @Hunter Mega Pack. But you can also change the loot to whatever you like.

Also, change the NPC loadouts to match what you use. Everything is in the folders, so just add what you like.

That's it. You're done! Congratulations, you now have the Banditas collection of quests for your server. I hope you like it... Some quests I found on the internet and fixed/updated. Other quests were edited by (Banditas231).

**New quests added:** 
Hunt animals and another for killing eAI. 
You need to change the rewards to your liking.

**Added Loadouts.**

# Some eAIs will now spawn in unique locations / sometimes move from point A to point Z. Zombie killing quests are now 1-2-3 (meaning you have to complete the first quest to unlock the second)
# Added ini.c This one needs for some quests, also your players spawn with custom gear (only clothes). And if player with name Survivor joins it gonna be naked, so this file helps me to have players with custom names.
