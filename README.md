**All the files I use on my server.**

## 

### Hello! These are my Expansion Quests for the Chernogorsk map.

### • Expansion has changed how quests work. Because of this, all quests edited or added from my working server now use custom loadouts and rewards. This means you need to adjust them to your own preference. I already have a video explaining how to do this.
That’s it — you’re done! Congratulations, you now have the **Banditas Collection** of quests for your server.  
I hope you enjoy them!

Some quests were found online and fixed/updated by me, while others were custom-edited by **Banditas231**.

### Required Mods: ONLY IF YOU USE MY LOADOUTS!!!

- `@MMG - Mighty's Military Gear`
- `@SNAFU Weapons`

### 🔄 Updates:

- `init.c` — this file is required for some quests. It also gives players custom starting clothes.

### 📦 How to Install/Use My Quests on Your Server:

1. Go to your DayZ server folder and navigate to:  
   `DayZServer\profiles\ExpansionMod\Quests`  
   (This is my path — yours may look similar)

2. Drag and drop the 3 folders provided (if you're using default Expansion settings and don’t yet have custom quests).

3. Start your server and adjust the quests as you like.

💪 I hope this helps some of you out there!
