**All the files I use on my server.**

---

### Hello! These are my Expansion Quests for the Chernogorsk map.

Some quests require specific mods for loot or eAI loadouts.

---

### Required Mods:

- `@MMG - Mighty's Military Gear`
- `@SNAFU Weapons`
- `@Hunter Mega Pack`

You can replace the loot with anything you prefer.  
Make sure to update the NPC loadouts to match your server setup.  
All the files are organized into folders, so you can easily pick and use what you need.

That’s it — you’re done! Congratulations, you now have the **Banditas Collection** of quests for your server.  
I hope you enjoy them!

Some quests were found online and fixed/updated by me, while others were custom-edited by **Banditas231**.
