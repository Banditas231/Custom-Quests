**All the files I use on my server.**

---

### **Hello! These are my Expansion Quests for the Chernogorsk map.**

Some quests require specific mods for loot or eAI loadouts.

---

### **Required Mods:**

- `@MMG - Mighty's Military Gear`
- `@SNAFU Weapons`
- `@Hunter Mega Pack`

You can replace the loot with anything you prefer.  
Make sure to update the NPC loadouts to match your server setup.  
All the files are organized into folders, so you can easily pick and use what you need.

That’s it — you’re done! Congratulations, you now have the **Banditas Collection** of quests for your server.  
I hope you enjoy them!

Some quests were found online and fixed/updated by me, while others were custom-edited by **Banditas231**.

### **New Quests Added:**

- **Pilot Crash chain quest 3 quests**
- 🔥 [NEW VIDEO #1]https://youtu.be/c_zEjZuaSmg
You will need a solution for the 1-2 PilotCrash issues: how to get zombies into the area.
3 is no problem; I use eAI.

Don’t forget to adjust the rewards to your liking.  
Loadouts have also been added.

### 🔄 **Updates:**

- Some eAI now spawn in unique locations and may move from point A to point Z.
- Zombie-killing quests are now tiered (1-2-3), meaning you must complete Quest 1 to unlock Quest 2, and so on.
- Added `init.c` — this file is required for some quests. It also gives players custom starting clothes.
- Players with the default name `"Survivor"` will spawn naked — this helps enforce custom names.

### 📦 **How to Install/Use My Quests on Your Server:**

1. Go to your DayZ server folder and navigate to:  
   `DayZServer\profiles\ExpansionMod\Quests`  
   (This is my path — yours may look similar)

2. Drag and drop the 3 folders provided (if you're using default Expansion settings and don’t yet have custom quests).

3. Start your server and adjust the quests as you like.
