# I keep my files updated, so people can use correct and working files.
# Last updated 12/15/2024 New quest and ini file
# Some eAIs will now spawn in unique locations / sometimes move from point A to point Z. Zombie killing quests are now 1-2-3 (meaning you have to complete the first quest to unlock the second)
# Added ini.c This one needs for some quests and Extraction, also you can spawn with custom gear (only clothes). Also if player with name Survivor joins it gonna be naked.
