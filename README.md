**All the files I use on my server.**

### Hello! These are my Expansion Quests for the Chernogorsk map.

Some quests require specific mods for loot or eAI loadouts.

---

### Required Mods: ONLY IF YOU USE MY LOADOUTS!!!

- `@MMG - Mighty's Military Gear`
- `@SNAFU Weapons`

Hello everyone, I spent a few hours rebuilding my quests. Now all quests have vanilla loadouts and loot.

That’s it — you’re done! Congratulations, you now have the **Banditas Collection** of quests for your server.  
I hope you enjoy them!

Some quests were found online and fixed/updated by me, while others were custom-edited by **Banditas231**.

### 📦 How to Install/Use My Quests on Your Server:

1. Go to your DayZ server folder and navigate to:  
   `DayZServer\profiles\ExpansionMod\Quests`  
   (This is my path — yours may look similar)

2. Drag and drop the 3 folders provided (if you're using default Expansion settings and don’t yet have custom quests).

3. Start your server and adjust the quests as you like.
